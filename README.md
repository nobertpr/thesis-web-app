# thesis-web-app

This is a repository containing the web app used for my thesis. The app is created using streamlit for the frontend and fastapi for the backend.

To run streamlit use:
`streamlit run 1_ðŸ”Ž_Predict.py`

To run fastapi use:
`uvicorn main:app --reload`

## Note
The models, some predicted images and maps are not included due to limitation of file size in github.
